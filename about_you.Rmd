# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
I attended San Fernando High School. I also graduated from San Fernando High School. I was creative in the english class. In math class I created many answers for the equations. Both subjects were equally difficult. I was better in math when I was younger. Here I have been avoiding math since I believed I could do better in English.
